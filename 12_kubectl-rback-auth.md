# Troubleshooting Kubernetes for Application Developers: Part 12- Understanding RBAC & Auth

### Deep Dive into kubectl RBAC & Auth: Common Issues and Troubleshooting

Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and the `kubectl auth` command are critical for managing permissions and authentication in a cluster. Developers often encounter challenges when troubleshooting access issues, especially during deployments or when managing cluster resources. Below, we’ll outline some common problems and how to identify and resolve them using `kubectl auth` commands.

---

### Common Issues with RBAC and Authentication

#### 1. **Role or RoleBinding Misconfiguration**
   - Developers might accidentally bind the wrong role to a user, group, or service account.
   - Lack of required permissions for specific operations leads to deployment or resource access failures.
   - **Example Error**: `Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "user2" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" at the cluster scope`.

---

#### 2. **ServiceAccount Misuse**
   - Using the default service account unintentionally, which might not have adequate permissions.
   - Misconfigured `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding` leads to unexpected behavior for workloads.

---

#### 3. **Namespace-Specific Access Denials**
   - Permissions granted for one namespace are not valid for another, causing issues with multi-namespace setups.

---

#### 4. **Multiple Actions Required**
   - Permissions are granted for one action (e.g., listing pods) but not another (e.g., deleting pods), leading to partial access errors.

---

#### 5. **Verbose Logs for Debugging**
   - Sometimes errors are hard to debug without detailed logs, such as when using `--v=10` for deep troubleshooting.

### Understanding and Using `kubectl auth` Commands

#### **1. Checking User Permissions**
   ```bash
   kubectl auth can-i list -n monitoring pod
   ```
   - **What It Does**: Verifies if the current user can list pods in the `monitoring` namespace.
   - **Troubleshooting**: If denied, check:
     - `RoleBinding` in the `monitoring` namespace.
     - The `Role` associated with the user or service account.

#### **2. Identifying the Current User**
   ```bash
   kubectl auth whoami
   ```
   - **What It Does**: Shows the identity of the current user interacting with the Kubernetes cluster.
   - **Troubleshooting**: Ensures you’re operating as the correct user. If you’re a service account, verify the bound `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding`.

#### **3. Testing Specific Users or Service Accounts**
   ```bash
   kubectl auth can-i list pods as=user2
   ```
   - **What It Does**: Checks if `user2` can list pods in the current namespace.
   - **Troubleshooting**: Use this when debugging RBAC for other users. Confirm `RoleBindings` for `user2` and the corresponding permissions in the `Role`.

#### **4. Verifying Permissions for Multiple Actions**
   ```bash
   kubectl auth can-i list,delete as=serviceaccount:default:default
   ```
   - **What It Does**: Tests if the `default` service account can list and delete resources.
   - **Troubleshooting**: This is helpful for validating permissions for service accounts running within the cluster.

#### **5. Debugging with Verbose Logs**
   ```bash
   kubectl auth can-i list -n monitoring pod --v=10
   ```
   - **What It Does**: Provides verbose logs for debugging the permission check process.
   - **Troubleshooting**: Use this to get detailed insights into what checks are being performed and why access is denied.

### How to Troubleshoot RBAC and Auth Issues

#### 1. **Inspect Roles and RoleBindings**
   - List roles and bindings to verify correct configuration:
     ```bash
     kubectl get rolebinding -n <namespace>
     kubectl describe rolebinding <rolebinding-name> -n <namespace>
     ```

#### 2. **Check ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding**
   - If the issue spans across namespaces, check `ClusterRoleBinding`:
     ```bash
     kubectl get clusterrolebinding
     kubectl describe clusterrolebinding <binding-name>
     ```

#### 3. **Audit Policies and Logs**
   - Enable Kubernetes auditing to track permission denials in detail.

#### 4. **Simulate Permissions**
   - Use `kubectl auth can-i` to simulate actions and verify RBAC settings before deployment.

#### 5. **ServiceAccount and Workloads**
   - Verify the service account used by a workload:
     ```bash
     kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
     ```
   - Check the service account's bound roles.

#### 6. **Review kubeconfig**
   - Ensure the correct kubeconfig is being used and corresponds to the intended user or service account.

### Example Scenario

**Issue**:
A developer deploys an application in the `monitoring` namespace, but it cannot list pods, resulting in a `403 Forbidden` error.

**Solution**:
1. Verify the user’s role binding:
   ```bash
   kubectl get rolebinding -n monitoring
   ```
2. Check the permissions granted in the associated role:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe role <role-name> -n monitoring
   ```
3. Test the user’s permissions explicitly:
   ```bash
   kubectl auth can-i list pods -n monitoring
   ```
4. Fix the role or binding if necessary, then recheck.
